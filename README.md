Resume Repository

Welcome to my Resume Repository, a collection of my personal coding projects designed for future employers to review. Each project showcases different aspects of my skills in software development, problem-solving, and coding proficiency.

Purpose
This repository serves as an online portfolio where employers can explore my technical abilities and coding style through the various projects I’ve worked on. The projects included span a range of languages, frameworks, and tools that I’ve gained experience with during my academic and personal journey.
